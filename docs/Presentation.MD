## INTRO - BARENTO

- App on passwords table page secure mode to start

- thanks / intro spiel

Our group is presenting the app PasswordKeepR

Introduce ourselves
  - Barento
  - Andrew **GET READY
  - Seamus

Maybe why we picked??

## STACK - ANDREW

On the front end, our app is built with jQuery for DOM manipulation, SASS for a CSS preprocessor, and the Pico CSS framework for styling

On the back-end we used NodeJS and Express for our server, PostgreSQL for our database

We chose to build our app as a single-page application, sacrificing a bit of load time for a more seamless user experience for the rest of the user story

And now i'll pass it on to Seamus who will start showing you our app

## DEMO - PASSWORDS TABLE - SEAMUS

start off the demo on the passwords table page with secure mode
  - a list of all an organizations passwords, hint that we'll demo another org after
  - information that gets displayed
  - copy in one click
  - search feature
  - Add category button and category filter feature

## DEMO - SECURE MODE - ANDREW

Our app features a secure mode where all the passwords, normally shown in plain-text are protected from prying eyes

Once the mode is turned on, the user will be asked for authentication to reveal any password

The user can't edit passwords until secure mode is turned off

And turning off secure mode requires user authentication

Now I will pass it to Barento, who will demonstrate editing and creating passwords

## DEMO - EDIT + CREATE PASSWORDS - BARENTO

Passwords are unique to organizations - we'll log out and show you a different password table displaying for a member of a different organization

A logged in user can edit details about a password
  - username, password, description, and can reassign categories

Any user can create a password
  - enter all the info about the service / username
  - a user can generate a password given a few parameters they choose
    - includes special characters, uppercase, and length
  - password gets added to passwords table

## LESSONS LEARNED - SEAMUS

We learned a lot working together on this project

The level of communication and planning was an eye opener

Deciding on app structure was time consuming but helped understanding of the project

Remaining available during merges to fix any conflicts that might pop up

Dividing and conquering tasks

MVP - making sure to build the simplest version of something first, get it working, then add features onto it

Thank you!
